<h4 id="board-design">Board Design</h4>

<p>I started by working in KiCad, but ran into issues importing libraries and exporting. Eagle seemed to have better documentation (both in terms of HTM(A)A classmate support and online discussions), so I eventually switched to using it.</p>

<p>First, I layed out the schematic in Eagle. I got the basics down first, and then added an LED to pin 11 (with a resistor on the ground side) and a button to pin 5. I didn&rsquo;t realize it at the time, but since I didn&rsquo;t include a pull-up resistor with the button, I would need to rely on the ATTiny&rsquo;s internal pull-up resistor. Here&rsquo;s how things looked after completing the schematic:</p>

<p><img src="../../img/04/04_schematic.jpg" alt="schematic" /></p>

<p>Next, it was time to turn the ratsnest into the board layout. It took a few iterations to get a configuration where things worked out without requiring the other side of the board or jumper wires.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/04/04_board.png" alt="board" /></p>

<hr />

<h4 id="milling">Milling</h4>

<p>The milling process itself was smooth, but after the job was complete I realized that I hadn&rsquo;t set up the design rules properly in Eagle. Some of the traces were too close, and the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>64</sub>&rdquo; endmill didn&rsquo;t get between them (see the left side of the ATTiny, and the FTDI header).</p>

<p><img src="../../img/04/04_pcb-a.jpg" alt="pcb traces too close" /></p>

<p>Sure enough, I had set the minimum distance between traces to 0.01mm in Eagle, but looking back to Week 3 when we characterized the endmill, it should have been set to 0.020mm. I updated the design rules, and the warnings were exactly where they were expected:</p>

<p><img src="../../img/04/04_pcb-b.jpg" alt="pcb traces too close in eagle" /></p>

<p>I went back to fix them, and also realized that I needed to update the grid size to .5mm rather than .25mm so that the lines could snap more easily to where I wanted them. Then, I milled again:</p>

<p><img src="../../img/04/04_pcb-c.jpg" alt="final mill" /></p>

<p><strong>Things I did wrong:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Set up design rules in Eagle that were too lax</li>
<li>Forgot to update the grid size for easier layouts</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 id="soldering">Soldering</h4>

<p>Next up: soldering. This went relatively smoothy, although the resonator was one of the tricker components to solder. I was sure to get the proper orientation for the ATTiny by looking at the board in Eagle and checking where the little circle was (top left). I neglected to check the orientation on the LED, which caused some problems when I went to test the board. The (nearly invisible) green line should go on the ground side.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/04/04_pcb-d.jpg" alt="soldered board" /></p>

<p>I tested connections with the multimeter, and didn&rsquo;t find anything unexpected, so I moved onto programming.</p>

<p><strong>Things I did wrong:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Flipped the orientation of the LED</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 id="programming">Programming</h4>

<p>Next, I used the USBTiny to program the board on the lab&rsquo;s computer. Because of issues with the Ubuntu virtual machine, we were running Arduino on Windows. First, I ran the blink sample file to confirm that I had identified the pin correctly in code.</p>

<p>The LED didn&rsquo;t light up, although I could see the blinking pattern when I used the multimeter to try to diagnose, at which point I learned that my LED was backwards. It was a good excuse to try out the heat gun to remove the LED from the board, before resoldering in the correct orientation. When I plugged the board back in, it blinked.</p>

<p>Next, I tried programming functionality in the button&hellip;.</p>

<p>Things I did wrong were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identified the wrong pins for the LED and button in code.</li>
<li>Didn&rsquo;t turn on the pull-up resistor in the ATTiny</li>
</ul>
