<h4 id="laser-cutting-press-fit-kit">Laser Cutting - Press Fit Kit</h4>

<p>Usually when I laser cut, I do it with a specific form in mind. I&rsquo;ve created some kind of three dimensional model in Rhino or Grasshopper, and want to build it out of planar pieces. In this case, since the goal was to create a press fit kit that could be assembled in multiple ways, I wanted to see how simple shapes could come together to create variable form.</p>

<p>Working in Grasshopper, I laid out pieces so that their notches rotated slightly between pieces. I was hoping that this would allow for snakes, planes, or volumes that would slope gradually. This is what the pieces looked like:</p>

<p><img src="../../img/01/01-laser-drawing.jpg" alt="cut file" /></p>

<p>We characterized the laser cutter, testing notch dimensions and confirming the kerf width. Though the corrugated cardboard was 0.250&rdquo; thick, the test notches (shown below) showed that the notches should be drawn at 0.240&rdquo; wide to ensure that the pieces fit snugly without requiring too much force to go in. It took several test cuts to settle on a speed setting of 20% and power setting of 45% to get a clean cut on the machine.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/01/01-laser-notch.jpg" alt="notches" /></p>

<p>After cutting the first set of pieces, the kit created natural arcing curves when assembled sequentially, as I had hoped. However, this only worked when the pieces were assembled linearly. Since the notches were positioned at the midpoints of the pieces&rsquo; edges, there were clashes when I tried to create more volumetric shapes.</p>

<p>To try to address this, I laser cut a few different types of spacers, which gave the primary pieces some room to breathe. This helped to create a wider range of ways to assemble the pieces together. Still, the natural curves that I was hoping to see when the pieces came together weren&rsquo;t always apparent.</p>

<h4 id="vinyl-cutting">Vinyl Cutting</h4>

<p>I vinyl cut stickers with my roommates&rsquo; profiles so that they could stick them to their things in the fridge. The vinyl cutter was relatively straightforward to use. It took a couple of tries to get the pressure high enough that it would cut through the vinyl but low enough that it wouldn&rsquo;t cut through the substrate.</p>

<p>I ran into some issues loading the vinyl roll and setting the origin but was able to solve it with a bit of trial and error. The excess vinyl would have gone to waste, so I tried cutting the stickers at a few different sizes on the scrap.</p>
